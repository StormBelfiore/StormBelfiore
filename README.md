# Hi, I‚Äôm Storm üëã

I build secure, human-centered backends and dashboards:
- FastAPI + systemd services with health checks
- Cryptographic signing & verification pipelines (SSH `ssh-keygen -Y`)
- Evented dashboards for file-based workflows
- Linux ops (services, timers, journald, hardening)

### Selected work
- **Aletheia: Signed Answer Pipeline**  
  FastAPI + systemd + SSH signatures with a real-time ‚ÄúRecent Answers‚Äù UI, secure download, and audit tooling.
- **Black Room Auditor**  
  `aos_doctor.sh` improvements: signature verification, bulk re-sign, allowed_signers management.

### What I offer
- Turn a rough script into a production service (unit files, timers, health endpoints)
- Build minimal, beautiful dashboards for file feeds or workflows
- Add cryptographic signatures to your pipeline and verify in CI
- Debug and harden SELinux/AppArmor/systemd/runtime quirks

**Open to contract/freelance ‚Äì reach out with your idea.**
